## Notes:
# HTML is skeleton of web projects, CSS is the skin of web projects and JavaScript is the controller of the web projects
Even single error can cause abnormal changes in the file.
We can use validator.w3.org for errors in html file.

# headars
In html headers are h1, h2, h3 and so on. We use headers mainly defining topics and subtopics in web pages. we can change the pixel size of the headers with CSS.

# paragraphs
In paragraphs, the space are by default removed with one. This is called white space collapsing. we can use &lt;br&gt; tags for line breaks.

# Elements
In HTML, &lt;p&gt;, &lt;h1&gt; etc., are called as block level elements. &lt;em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt; are inline elements and nested within block level elements.

# HTML entities
These are the character that cannot be typed and managed like want to have more whitespaces, greater than(&gt;), less than(&lt;) symbols etc., HTML entities usually start with &.

# Lists
The list tags are used to display data with bullet points, numbers etc., Examples for list tags are &lt;ol&gt;,&lt;ul&gt;,&lt;dl&gt; etc., 

# Links
'link' tag is used to access the resources wheather they are local or some other resources from the internet.<br>
'anchor' tags is used to move between different pages. <br>
### Best practices using links
